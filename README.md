# Local Library Application
This application allows users to navigate and browse through a sample library database and sort books and accounts by their stats, as well as sort the library by Genres, Popularity, and Authors.
This was built using JavaScript programming, and Test Driven Development was done using Mocha and Chai. I worked on this during Week 2 of my Software Engineering Course at Thinkful.
